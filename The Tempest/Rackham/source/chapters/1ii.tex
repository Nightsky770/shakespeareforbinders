\begin{verse_speech}[Miranda] 
If by your art, my dearest father, you have\\
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.\\
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,\\
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,\\
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered\\
With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,\\
Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,\\
Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock\\
Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.\\
Had I been any god of power, I would\\
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere\\
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and\\
The fraughting souls within her.\\
\end{verse_speech}


\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
\hspace{\widthof{The fraughting souls within her.}}Be collected:\\
No more amazement: tell your piteous heart\\
There's no harm done.\\
\end{verse_speech}

\verseline[Miranda]{\hspace{\widthof{There's no harm done.}}O, woe the day!}
	
\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
\hspace{\widthof{There's no harm done. O, woe the day!}}No harm.\\
I have done nothing but in care of thee,\\
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who\\
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing\\
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better\\
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,\\
And thy no greater father.
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Miranda] 
\hspace{\widthof{And thy no greater father.}}More to know\\
Did never meddle with my thoughts.
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
\hspace{\widthof{Did never meddle with my thoughts.}}'Tis time\\
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,\\
And pluck my magic garment from me. So:\\
\stage{Lays down his mantle}
Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.\\
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd\\
The very virtue of compassion in thee,\\
I have with such provision in mine art\\
So safely ordered that there is no soul—\\
No, not so much perdition as an hair\\
Betid to any creature in the vessel\\
Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;\\
For thou must now know farther.
\end{verse_speech}

\stage{They sit.}

\begin{verse_speech}[Miranda] 
\hspace{\widthof{For thou must now know farther.}}You have often\\
Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd\\
And left me to a bootless inquisition,\\
Concluding <Stay: not yet.>
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
\hspace{\widthof{Concluding <Stay: not yet.>}}The hour's now come;\\
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;\\
Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember\\
A time before we came unto this cell?\\
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not\\
Out three years old.
\end{verse_speech}


\verseline[Miranda]{\hspace{\widthof{Out three years old.}}Certainly, sir, I can.}
	
\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
By what? by any other house or person?\\
Of any thing the image tell me that\\
Hath kept with thy remembrance.
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Miranda] 
\hspace{\widthof{Hath kept with thy remembrance.}}'Tis far off\\
And rather like a dream than an assurance\\
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not\\
Four or five women once that tended me?

Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it\\
That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else\\
In the dark backward and abysm of time?\\
If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,\\
How thou camest here thou mayst.
\end{verse_speech}

\verseline[Miranda]{\hspace{\widthof{How thou camest here thou mayst.}}But that I do not.}

\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
	Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,\\
Thy father was the Duke of Milan and\\
A prince of power.
\end{verse_speech}

\verseline[Miranda]{\hspace{\widthof{A prince of power.}}Sir, are not you my father?}

\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and\\
She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father\\
Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir\\
And princess no worse issued.
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Miranda] 
\hspace{\widthof{And princess no worse issued.}}O the heavens!\\
What foul play had we, that we came from thence?\\
Or blessèd was't we did?
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
\hspace{\widthof{Or blessèd was't we did?}}Both, both, my girl:\\
By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,\\
But blessedly holp hither.
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Miranda] 
\hspace{\widthof{But blessedly holp hither.}}O, my heart bleeds\\
To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,\\
Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio—\\
I pray thee, mark me—that a brother should\\
Be so perfidious!—he whom next thyself\\
Of all the world I loved and to him put\\
The manage of my state; as at that time\\
Through all the signories it was the first\\
And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed\\
In dignity, and for the liberal arts\\
Without a parallel; those being all my study,\\
The government I cast upon my brother\\
And to my state grew stranger, being transported\\
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle—\\
Dost thou attend me?
\end{verse_speech}

\verseline[Miranda]{\hspace{\widthof{Dost thou attend me?}}Sir, most heedfully.}
	
\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
Being once perfected how to grant suits,\\
How to deny them, who to advance and who\\
To trash for over-topping, new created\\
The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,\\
Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key\\
Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state\\
To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was\\
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,\\
And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.
\end{verse_speech}

\verseline[Miranda]{O, good sir, I do.}
	
\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
\hspace{\widthof{O, good sir, I do.}}I pray thee, mark me.\\
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated\\
To closeness and the bettering of my mind\\
With that which, but by being so retired,\\
O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother\\
Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,\\
Like a good parent, did beget of him\\
A falsehood in its contrary as great\\
As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,\\
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,\\
Not only with what my revenue yielded,\\
But what my power might else exact, like one\\
Who having into truth, by telling of it,\\
Made such a sinner of his memory,\\
To credit his own lie, he did believe\\
He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution\\
And executing the outward face of royalty,\\
With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing—\\
Dost thou hear?
\end{verse_speech}

\verseline[Miranda]{Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.}
	
\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
To have no screen between this part he play'd\\
And him he play'd it for, he needs will be\\
Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library\\
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties\\
He thinks me now incapable; confederates—\\
So dry he was for sway—wi' the King of Naples\\
To give him annual tribute, do him homage,\\
Subject his coronet to his crown and bend\\
The dukedom yet unbow'd—alas, poor Milan!—\\
To most ignoble stooping.
\end{verse_speech}

\verseline[Miranda]{\hspace{\widthof{To most ignoble stooping.}}O the heavens!}
	
\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
Mark his condition and the event; then tell me\\
If this might be a brother.
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Miranda] 
\hspace{\widthof{If this might be a brother.}}I should sin\\
To think but nobly of my grandmother:\\
Good wombs have borne bad sons.
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
\hspace{\widthof{Good wombs have borne bad sons.}}Now the condition.\\
The King of Naples, being an enemy\\
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;\\
Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises\\
Of homage and I know not how much tribute,\\
Should presently extirpate me and mine\\
Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan\\
With all the honours on my brother: whereon,\\
A treacherous army levied, one midnight\\
Fated to the purpose did Antonio open\\
The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,\\
The ministers for the purpose hurried thence\\
Me and thy crying self.
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Miranda] 
\hspace{\widthof{Me and thy crying self.}}Alack, for pity!\\
I, not remembering how I cried out then,\\
Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint\\
That wrings mine eyes to't.
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
\hspace{\widthof{That wrings mine eyes to't.}}Hear a little further\\
And then I'll bring thee to the present business\\
Which now's upon's; without the which this story\\
Were most impertinent.
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Miranda] 
\hspace{\widthof{Were most impertinent.}}Wherefore did they not\\
That hour destroy us?
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
\hspace{\widthof{That hour destroy us?}}Well demanded, wench:\\
My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,\\
So dear the love my people bore me, nor set\\
A mark so bloody on the business, but\\
With colours fairer painted their foul ends.\\
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,\\
Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared\\
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,\\
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats\\
Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,\\
To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh\\
To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,\\
Did us but loving wrong.
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Miranda] 
\hspace{\widthof{That hour destroy us?}}Alack, what trouble\\
Was I then to you!
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
\hspace{\widthof{Was I then to you!}}O, a cherubim\\
Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.\\
Infusèd with a fortitude from heaven,\\
When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,\\
Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me\\
An undergoing stomach, to bear up\\
Against what should ensue.
\end{verse_speech}

\verseline[Miranda]{How came we ashore?}
	
\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
By Providence divine.\\
Some food we had and some fresh water that\\
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,\\
Out of his charity, being then appointed\\
Master of this design, did give us, with\\
Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,\\
Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,\\
Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me\\
From mine own library with volumes that\\
I prize above my dukedom.
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Miranda] 
\hspace{\widthof{I prize above my dukedom.}}Would I might\\
But ever see that man!
\end{verse_speech}


\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
\hspace{\widthof{But ever see that man!}}Now I arise:\\
\stage{Stands and resumes his mantle}
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.\\
Here in this island we arrived; and here\\
Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit\\
Than other princesses can that have more time\\
For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Miranda] 
Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,\\
For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason\\
For raising this sea-storm?
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
\hspace{\widthof{For raising this sea-storm?}}Know thus far forth.\\
By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,\\
Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies\\
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience\\
I find my zenith doth depend upon\\
A most auspicious star, whose influence\\
If now I court not but omit, my fortunes\\
Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:\\
Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dullness,\\
And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.\\

Approach, my Ariel, come.\\

\begin{verse_speech}[Ariel] 
All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come\\
To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,\\
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride\\
On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task\\
Ariel and all his quality.
\end{verse_speech}

\hspace{\widthof{Ariel and all his quality.}}Hast thou, spirit,\\
Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Ariel] 
To every article.\\
I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,\\
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,\\
I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,\\
And burn in many places; on the topmast,\\
The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,\\
Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors\\
O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary\\
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks\\
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune\\
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,\\
Yea, his dread trident shake.
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
\hspace{\widthof{Yea, his dread trident shake.}}My brave spirit!\\
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil\\
Would not infect his reason?
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Ariel] 
\hspace{\widthof{Would not infect his reason?}}Not a soul\\
But felt a fever of the mad and play'd\\
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners\\
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,\\
Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,\\
With hair up-staring,—then like reeds, not hair,—\\
Was the first man that leap'd; cried, <Hell is empty\\
And all the devils are here.>

Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain\\
A dozen years; within which space she died\\
And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans\\

Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me\\
Water with berries in't, and teach me how\\
To name the bigger light, and how the less,\\
That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee\\
And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,\\
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:\\
Cursed be I that did so! All the charms\\
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!\\
For I am all the subjects that you have,\\
Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me\\
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me\\
The rest o' the island.

Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour\\
One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,\\
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like\\
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes\\
With words that made them known. But thy vile race,\\
Though thou didst learn, had that in't which good natures\\
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou\\
Deservedly confined into this rock,\\
Who hadst deserved more than a prison.

\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
If I have too austerely punish'd you,\\
Your compensation makes amends, for I\\
Have given you here a third of mine own life,\\
Or that for which I live; who once again\\
I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations\\
Were but my trials of thy love and thou\\
Hast strangely stood the test here, afore Heaven,\\
I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,\\
Do not smile at me that I boast her off,\\
For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise\\
And make it halt behind her.

Against an oracle.

\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition\\
Worthily purchased take my daughter: but\\
If thou dost break her virgin-knot before\\
All sanctimonious ceremonies may\\
With full and holy rite be minister'd,\\
No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall\\
To make this contract grow: but barren hate,\\
Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew\\
The union of your bed with weeds so loathly\\
That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,\\
As Hymen's lamps shall light you.
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Ferdinand] 
\hspace{\widthof{As Hymen's lamps shall light you.}}As I hope\\
For quiet days, fair issue and long life,\\
With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,\\
The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion.\\
Our worser genius can, shall never melt\\
Mine honour into lust, to take away\\
The edge of that day's celebration\\
When I shall think: or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd,\\
Or Night kept chain'd below.
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
\hspace{\widthof{Or Night kept chain'd below.}}Fairly spoke.\\
Sit then and talk with her; she is thine own.\\

Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service\\

In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,\\
O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place:\\
Incite them to quick motion; for I must\\
Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple\\
Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,\\

Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas\\
Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;\\
Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,\\
And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;\\
Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,\\
Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,\\
To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom-groves,\\
Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,\\
Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard;\\
And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,\\
Where thou thyself dost air;—the queen o' the sky,\\
Whose watery arch and messenger am I,\\
Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,\\
Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,\\
To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain:\\
Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.

Hail, many-colour'd messenger, that ne'er\\
Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;\\
Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers\\
Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers,\\
And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown\\
My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,\\
Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen\\
Summon'd me hither, to this short-grass'd green?
\end{verse_speech}

And some donation freely to estate\\
On the blest lovers.

If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,\\

\hspace{\widthof{I have forsworn.}}Of her society\\
Be not afraid: I met her deity\\
Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son\\
Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done\\
Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,\\
Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid\\
Till Hymen's torch be lighted: but vain;\\
Mars's hot minion is returned again;\\
Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,\\
Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows\\
And be a boy right out.

There's something else to do: hush, and be mute,\\

You nymphs, call'd Naiads, of the windring brooks,\\
With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,\\

Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate\\
A contract of true love; be not too late.\\
\enter{certain Nymphs}
You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary,\\
Come hither from the furrow and be merry:\\
Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on\\
And these fresh nymphs encounter every one\\
In country footing.

Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
You do look, my son, in a moved sort,\\
As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.\\
Our revels now are ended. These our actors,\\
As I foretold you, were all spirits and\\
Are melted into air, into thin air:\\
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,\\
The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,\\
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,\\
Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve\\
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,\\
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff\\
As dreams are made on, and our little life\\
Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;\\
Bear with my weakness; my, brain is troubled:\\
Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:\\
If you be pleased, retire into my cell\\
And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,\\
To still my beating mind.

Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,\\
I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear'd\\
Lest I might anger thee.
\end{verse_speech}

\verseline[Prospero]{Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?}



\begin{verse_speech}[Ariel] 
I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;\\
So fun of valour that they smote the air\\
For breathing in their faces; beat the ground\\
For kissing of their feet; yet always bending\\
Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour;\\
At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd their ears,\\
Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses\\
As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears\\
That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through\\
Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,\\
Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them\\
I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,\\
There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake\\
O'erstunk their feet.
\end{verse_speech}

\begin{verse_speech}[Prospero] 
\hspace{\widthof{O'erstunk their feet.}}This was well done, my bird.\\
Thy shape invisible retain thou still:\\

For stale to catch these thieves.

Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;\\
And as with age his body uglier grows,\\
So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,\\
Even to roaring.

Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.

\verseline[Trinculo]{Thou wert but a lost monster.}

\begin{verse_speech}[Caliban] 
Good my lord, give me thy favour still.\\
Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to\\
Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.\\
All's hush'd as midnight yet.
\end{verse_speech}

\verseline[Trinculo]{Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,—}

\verseline[Stephano]{There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that, monster, but an infinite loss.}

\verseline[Trinculo]{That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your harmless fairy, monster.}

\verseline[Stephano]{I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears for my labour.}

Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,\\
This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.\\
Do that good mischief which may make this island\\
Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,\\
For aye thy foot-licker.

To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone\\
And do the murder first: if he awake,\\
From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,\\
Make us strange stuff.
